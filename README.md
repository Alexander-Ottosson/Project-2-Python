# Project-2-Python

The Mechanized Vehicle Management System allows for users to manage an inventory of mechs. Admins can add mechs to the database, update a mechs info, or delete them. Pilots can view detailed information about a mech and check them out of the inventory for missions. If a user isn't logged in they are still able to view some mechs info, but Admins are able to set a mech as confidential, which prevents anonymous users from viewing it. Users can also leave reviews on mechs.

Technologies Used:
REST, SQL, JavaScript, Java, Python, Flask, Javalin, Selenium
